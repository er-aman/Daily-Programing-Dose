Implement int sqrt(int x).

Compute and return the square root of x, where x is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

Example 1:

Input: 4
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.

class Solution:
    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        if x<2:
            return x
        l,r = 2, x//2
        while l<=r:
            mid = (l+r)//2
            num = mid*mid
            if num>x:
                r=mid-1
            elif num<x:
                l = mid+1 
            else:
                return mid
        return r
