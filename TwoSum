Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

Example:

Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,

Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9,
return [0, 1].





class Solution(object):
    def twoSum(self, nums, target):
        """
        :type nums: List[int]
        :type target: int
        :rtype: List[int]
        """
        # I will take a dict
        dict = {}
        # iterate over the numbers to get their indicies and the values
        # taking the number as the key and its index as value as we need to return the indices
        
        for i, val in enumerate(nums):
          a = target - val 
          if a in dict:
            return [dict[a],i]
          else:
            dict[val] = i
